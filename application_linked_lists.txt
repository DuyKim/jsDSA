Linked list is used in a wide variety of applications such as:
    1. Polynomial Manipulation representation
    2. Addition of long positive intergers
    3. Representation of square matrices
    4. Addition of long positive intergers
    5. Symbol table creation
    6. Mailing list
    7. Memory management
    8. Linked allocation of files
    9. Multipe precision arithmetic

1. Polynomial Manipulation
    Each node of a linked list representing polynomial constitute three parts:
        The first part contains the value of the coefficient of the term.
        The second part contains the value of the exponent
        The third part, LINK points to the next term

        || Coefficient || exponent || Linked
            7               x^2         next


    P(x) = 7x2 + 15x3 - 2x2 + 9

2. Addition of Polynomial:

    P(x) = 3x4 + 2x3 - 4x2 + 7
    Q(x) = 5x3 + 4x2 - 5

3. Addition of long positive interger using linked list
    let a = 123456789
    head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 ...

4. Polynomial of Multipe Variables

    coefficient || exponentX || exponentY || exponentZ || LINK

    P(x, y, z) = 10x2y2z + 17xy2z3 ...

5. Memory Management: it is one of the operating system's key features. 
It decides how to allocate and reclaim storage for processes running on the system.
We can use a linked list to keep tack of portions of memory available for allocation.

6. Mailing list: Linked Lists have their use in email applications.
Since it is difficult to predict multiple lists, maybe a mailer builds a linked list of addresses before sending a message.

7. LISP: it is an acronym for LIST processor, an important programing language in AI.
This language extensively uses linked lists in performing symbolic processing.

8. Linked allocation of files: A file of large size may not be stored in one place on a disk.
So there must be some mechanism to link all the scattered parts of the file together.
The use of a linked list allows an efficient file allocation method in which each block of a file contains a pointer to the flie's text block.
But this method is good only for sequential access.

9. Virtual Memory: An interesting application of linked lists is found in the way systems support virtual memory.

10. Support for other data structures: Some other data structures like stacks, queues, graphs, trees can be implemented using a linked list.
