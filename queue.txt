A Queue is also a data structure, but you can remove only the first added element.
This is a principle known as first in, first out (FIFO).
A Queue is also great because of the constant time in its operation
Similiar to stack, it has limitations because only one item can be access at a time.
Queues should be used over arrays when you need to work with data in the FIFO form where the algorithm only needs to access the first added element.

In Javascript, arrays have methods that define the queue class: shiff() and push(). Recall that the shiff() method on an array in Js removes and returns the first added element of the array. Adding to a queue is commonly known as enqueuing and removing from a queue known as dequeuing.
shiff() can be used for the dequeue, and push() can be used for enqueuing
